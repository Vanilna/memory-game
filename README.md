Simple game, which I saw often in the museums.

The game should have 6 (level 1), 8 (level 2) or 12 (level 3) cards and a player should find matches between them.

If he or she will find a match from the first try - it gives 5 points, from the second - 3 points and from the third and more - 1 point.

At the bottom of the screen, a player should see the score of the game and the top score of all his games.

The "New Game" button starts a new game on the level 1 and sets a top score to 0 (as if a new player started his game).

Changing levels doesn't affect the top score.


I'm making it with React for learning reasons.
